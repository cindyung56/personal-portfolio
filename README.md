# My Personal Portfolio

## Process

I created a brief wireframe using Clip Studio Paint. I wanted to get started on this project as soon as I possibly could, so I decided to draw it by hand instead of using a wireframing tool (though I would love to use it in the future!). This is the wireframe I roughly created using the color scheme and a rough layout of how I wanted my portfolio to look:

## Inspiration / Resources

When researching a color palette, I initially wanted to incorporate some sort of peach and aqua color as contrast, but the shades were a bit bright for my liking and didn't clash well at first. But after searching on Google, I found the Pink Swan palette created by icolorpalette on Pinterest:
