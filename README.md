# My Personal Portfolio

## About

This is my personal portfolio showcasing all of my projects throughout my coding career. A portfolio is a great way for me to not only show off what I can do, but is also great to add on in the future when I do more projects and get more experience. It would be nice to look back at my starting projects and see what I can do to edit them or look back at how I coded. This portfolio gives me and future employers an easily accessible resource on what I can do and what projects I have been involved in. It's an organized page including a small summary about me, my work, and my contact information.

I learned a lot in the time I created my portfolio. While I knew some HTML and CSS beforehand, it was challenging but also very fun to create an interactive and responsive page from scratch. I applied many things I learned such as media queries, psuedo-classes, variables, and more. I'm particularly proud of being able to utilize the color scheme in a way that looked visually appealing and being able to make my project cards interactive and animated using CSS. At the same time, I didn't want to go overboard with everything so I also decided a simple design would be best, with the main focus being the projects as the user scrolls down. I think this fits my style, as I enjoy more simplistic designs and I believe this is reflected well in my portfolio.

I plan on eventually reuploading this website as my new portfolio once I have updated it and added more projects and experience.

## Inspiration

When researching a color palette, I initially wanted to incorporate some sort of peach and aqua color as contrast, but the shades were a bit bright for my liking and didn't clash well at first. But after searching on Google, I found the Pink Swan palette created by icolorpalette on Pinterest:

From looking online, I decided I would want a card system to store all my projects, where I have sections on my page that would show a picture of a core image or of the website itself on the card. This was most definitely going to be the most challenging part, but I wanted to test myself and try. The About Me section was also loosely based on my old portfolio (which is still published but is heavily outdated). I didn't want to spend too much time on the About section but it was definitely worth seeing if I could use my newfound knowledge of flexbox and responsiveness to make this section responsive. Similarly, I wanted to use flexbox to create boxes for my contact links, and have them in their own containers even when the page is resized.

## Process

I created a brief wireframe using Clip Studio Paint and my trusty tablet. I wanted to get started on this project as soon as I possibly could, so I decided to draw it by hand instead of using a wireframing tool (though I would love to use it in the future!). This is the wireframe I roughly created using the color scheme and a rough layout of how I wanted my portfolio to look:

After creating my wireframe, I used it as a loose guide to create my portfolio. I started off immediately with semantic HTML elements and creating variables for the colors I would be using in the CSS file. While the wireframe is not 100% the same as my final result, I am nevertheless still happy with it and the wireframe helped immensely in giving me a guide to what I wanted to make.
